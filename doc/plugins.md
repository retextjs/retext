## List of Utilities

See [**nlcst**][nlcst-util] for a list of utilities for working with the syntax
tree.
See [`unist`][unist-util] for other utilities which work with **nlcst**
nodes, too.
Finally, see [**vfile**][vfile-util] for a list of utilities working with
virtual files.

## Using plugins

To use a plugin invoke the [`use()`][unified-use] function.

## Creating plugins

Have an idea for a plugin?
Post it on [spectrum][] or in [ideas][] and make it happen!

To create a plugin, first read up on the [concept of plugins][unified-plugins].
Then, read the [guide on “Creating a plugin with unified”][guide].
Finally, take one of existing plugins, which looks similar to what you’re about
to make, and work from there.
If you get stuck, [spectrum][], [ideas][], and [issues][] are good places to get
help.

You should pick a name prefixed by `'retext-'`, such as `retext-spell`.

**Do not use the `retext-` prefix** if the thing you create doesn’t work with
`retext().use()`: it isn’t a “plugin” and will confuse users.
If it works with nlcst, use `'nlcst-util-'`, if it works with any unist tree,
use `unist-util-`, and if it works with virtual files, use `vfile-`.
