## List of utilities

See [nlcst][nlcst-util] for a list of utilities that work with the syntax tree.
See [unist][unist-util] for other utilities which work with nlcst and other
syntax trees too.
Finally, see [vfile][vfile-util] for a list of utilities working with virtual
files.

## Using plugins

To use a plugin programmatically, call the [`use()`][unified-use] function.

## Creating plugins

To create a plugin, first read up on the [concept of plugins][unified-plugins].
Then, read the [guide on “Creating a plugin with unified”][guide].
Finally, take one of existing plugins, which looks similar to what you’re about
to make, and work from there.
If you get stuck, [discussions][] is a good place to get help.

You should pick a name prefixed by `'retext-'` (such as `retext-emoji`).
**Do not use the `retext-` prefix** if the thing you create doesn’t work with
`retext().use()`: it isn’t a “plugin” and will confuse users.
If it works with nlcst, use `'nlcst-'`, if it works with any unist tree, use
`unist-util-`, and if it works with virtual files, use `vfile-`.

Use default exports to expose plugins from your packages, add `retext-plugin`
keywords in `package.json`, add a `retext-plugin` topic to your repo on GitHub,
and create a pull request to add the plugin here on this page!
