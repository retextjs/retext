## List of Utilities

See [**nlcst**][nlcst-util] for a list of utilities for working with
the CST.  See [`unist`][unist-util] for other utilities which work with
**nlcst** nodes, too.

And finally, see [`wooorm/vfile`][vfile-util] for a list of utilities
for working with virtual files.

## Using plugins

To use a plug-in programmatically, invoke the [`use()`][unified-use]
function.

## Creating plugins

First, read up on the [concept of plug-ins][unified-plugins].
Then, I suggest taking one of existing [plug-ins][plugins], which looks
similar to what you’re about to do, and work from there.  If you get
stuck, [issues][] and [Gitter][] are good places to get help.

A good place for publishing plug-ins is [npm][npm-publish].

You should pick a name prefixed by `"retext-"`, such as `retext-lint`.

When publishing a plug-in, you should use the package manager’s keywords
functionality and include `"retext"` in the list.
