> Hey all! First, thanks a lot for watching, starring, and forking retext!
Secondly, I wanted to invite you all to leave any [feedback](mailto:tituswormer@gmail.com) or [issues](https://github.com/wooorm/retext/issues) you might have, to help me make retext even cooler :smile:.

---

**retext** is an extensible natural language system—by default using [parse-latin](https://github.com/wooorm/parse-latin) to transform natural language into a [TextOM](https://github.com/wooorm/textom/) object model. Retext provides a pluggable system for analysing and manipulating natural language in JavaScript, NodeJS, and the browser. Tests provide 100% coverage.

> Rather than being a do-all library for Natural Language Processing (e.g., [NLTK](http://www.nltk.org) or [OpenNLP](https://opennlp.apache.org)), **retext** aims to be useful for more practical use cases (such as censoring profane words or decoding emoticons, but the possibilities are endless) instead of more academic goals (research purposes).
> **retext** is inherently modular — it uses plugins (similar to [rework](https://github.com/reworkcss/rework/) for CSS) instead of providing everything out of the box (e.g., [Natural](https://github.com/NaturalNode/natural)). This makes **retext** a viable tool for use on the web.

## Installation

NPM:
```sh
$ npm install retext
```

Component.js:
```sh
$ component install wooorm/retext
```

## Flashy demos

Most [plugins](https://github.com/wooorm/retext#plugins) have working examples. All available demos are listed under the plugins section, but some of the coolest include:

- [retext-smartypants](http://wooorm.github.io/retext-smartypants/);
- [retext-emoji](http://wooorm.github.io/retext-emoji/);
- [retext-double-metaphone](http://wooorm.github.io/retext-double-metaphone/);
- [retext-search](http://wooorm.github.io/retext-search/);
- [retext-porter-stemmer](http://wooorm.github.io/retext-porter-stemmer/);

## Usage

```js
var Retext = require('retext'),
    emoji = require('retext-emoji'),
    smartypants = require('retext-smartypants'),
    input;

// Modified first paragraph from: 
//   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_wise_monkeys
input = 'The three wise monkeys [. . .] sometimes called the ' +
        'three mystic apes--are a pictorial maxim. Together ' +
        'they embody the proverbial principle to ("see no evil, ' +
        'hear no evil, speak no evil"). The three monkeys are ' +
        'Mizaru (:see_no_evil:), covering his eyes, who sees no ' +
        'evil; Kikazaru (:hear_no_evil:), covering his ears, ' +
        'who hears no evil; and Iwazaru (:speak_no_evil:), ' +
        'covering his mouth, who speaks no evil.';

var text = new Retext()
  .use(emoji({
      'convert' : 'encode'
  }))
  .use(smartypants())
  .parse(input)
  .toString();
// The three wise monkeys […] sometimes called the three
// mystic apes—are a pictorial maxim. Together they
// embody the proverbial principle to (“see no evil,
// hear no evil, speak no evil”). The three monkeys are
// Mizaru (🙈), covering his eyes, who sees no evil;
// Kikazaru (🙉), covering his ears, who hears no evil;
// and Iwazaru (🙊), covering his mouth, who speaks no evil.
```

Plugins used: [retext-emoji](https://github.com/wooorm/retext-emoji) and [retext-smartypants](https://github.com/wooorm/retext-smartypants).

## API

### Retext(parser)
```js
var Retext = require('retext'),
    ParseEnglish = require('parse-english');

var retext = new Retext(new ParseEnglish()).parse(/* ...some english... */);
```

Return a new `Retext` instance with the given parser (defaults to parse-latin).

### Retext.prototype.use(plugin)

Takes a plugin—a humble function. When `Retext#parse` is called, the plugin will be invoked with the parsed tree, and the Retext instance as arguments. Returns self.

### Retext.prototype.parse(source)

Parses the given source and returns the (by `use`d plugins, modified) tree.

## Desired Plugins

> Hey! Want to create one of the following, or any other plugin, for retext but not sure where to start? I suggest to read retext-visit’s source code to see how it’s build first (it’s probably the most straight forward to learn), and go from there.

## Browser Support
Pretty much every browser (available through browserstack) runs all retext unit tests.

## Benchmark

Run the benchmark yourself:

```sh
$ npm run benchmark
```

On a MacBook Air, it parses about 2 big articles, 24 sections, or 218 paragraphs per second.

```
              retext.parse(source);
 218 op/s » A paragraph (5 sentences, 100 words)
  24 op/s » A section (10 paragraphs, 50 sentences, 1,000 words)
   2 op/s » An article (100 paragraphs, 500 sentences, 10,000 words)
```
