**retext** is an extensible natural language processor with support for
multiple languages. **retext** provides a pluggable system for analysing
and manipulating natural language in JavaScript. It works on Node and
in the Browser.

> Rather than being a do-all library for Natural Language Processing
> (such as [NLTK][] or [OpenNLP][]), **retext** aims to be useful for
> more practical use cases (such as checking for [insensitive words][alex]
> or decoding [emoticons][retext-emoji]) instead of more academic
> goals (research purposes).
> **retext** is inherently modular‚Äîit uses plugins (similar to
> [remark][] for markdown) instead of providing everything out of
> the box (such as  [Natural][]). This makes **retext** a viable
> tool for use on the web.

## Installation

[npm][]:

```bash
npm install retext
```

**retext** is also available as an AMD, CommonJS, and globals module,
[uncompressed and compressed][releases].

## Usage

The following example uses [**retext-emoji**][retext-emoji] to show
emoji and [**retext-smartypants**][retext-smartypants] for smart
punctuation.

Require dependencies:

```javascript
var retext = require('retext');
var emoji = require('retext-emoji');
var smartypants = require('retext-smartypants');
```

Create an instance using retext-emoji and -smartypants:

```javascript
var processor = retext().use(smartypants).use(emoji, {
    'convert' : 'encode'
});
```

Process a document:

```javascript
var doc = processor.process([
    'The three wise monkeys [. . .] sometimes called the three mystic',
    'apes--are a pictorial maxim. Together they embody the proverbial',
    'principle to ("see no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil"). The',
    'three monkeys are Mizaru (:see_no_evil:), covering his eyes, who',
    'sees no evil; Kikazaru (:hear_no_evil:), covering his ears, who',
    'hears no evil; and Iwazaru (:speak_no_evil:), covering his mouth,',
    'who speaks no evil.'
].join('\n'));
```

Yields (you need a browser which supports emoji to see them):

```text
The three wise monkeys [‚Ä¶] sometimes called the three mystic
apes‚Äîare a pictorial maxim. Together they embody the proverbial
principle to (‚Äúsee no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil‚Äù). The
three monkeys are Mizaru (üôà), covering his eyes, who
sees no evil; Kikazaru (üôâ), covering his ears, who
hears no evil; and Iwazaru (üôä), covering his mouth,
who speaks no evil.
```

## API

### `retext.use(plugin[, options])`

Change the way [**retext**][api] works by using a [plugin][].

**Signatures**

*   `processor = retext.use(plugin, options?)`;
*   `processor = retext.use(plugins)`.

**Parameters**

*   `plugin` (`Function`) ‚Äî A [**Plugin**][plugin];

*   `plugins` (`Array.<Function>`) ‚Äî A list of [**Plugin**][plugin]s;

*   `options` (`Object?`) ‚Äî Passed to the plugin. Specified by its
    documentation.

**Returns**

`Object` ‚Äî an instance of Retext: The returned object functions just like
**retext** (it has the same methods), but caches the `use`d plugins. This
provides the ability to chain `use` calls to use multiple plugins, but
ensures the functioning of the **retext** module does not change for other
dependents.

### `retext.process(value[, done])`

Parse a text document, apply plugins to it, and compile it into
something else.

**Parameters**

*   `value` ([`VFile`][vfile] or `string`)
    ‚Äî Text document;

*   `done` ([`Function`][done], optional).

**Returns**

`string?`: A document. Formatted in whatever plugins generate. The result is
`null` if a plugin is asynchronous, in which case the callback `done` should‚Äôve
been passed (don‚Äôt worry: plugin creators make sure you know its async).

### `function done(err, file, doc)`

Callback invoked when the output is generated with either an error, or the
processed document (represented as a virtual file and a string).

**Parameters**

*   `err` (`Error?`) ‚Äî Reason of failure;
*   `file` ([`VFile?`][vfile]) ‚Äî Virtual file;
*   `doc` (`string?`) ‚Äî Generated document.

## Plugin

### `function attacher(retext[, options])`

A plugin is a function, which takes the **Retext** instance a user attached
the plugin on as a first parameter and optional configuration as a second
parameter.

A plugin can return a `transformer`.

### `function transformer(node, file[, next])`

A transformer changes the provided document (represented as a node and a
virtual file).

Transformers can be asynchronous, in which case `next` must be invoked
(optionally with an error) when done.
